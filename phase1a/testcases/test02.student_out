testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: main creates XXp1; XXp1 creates a pair of XXp2 procs; join() each parent with all its children.  (children are always higher priority than parents, in this testcase)
Phase 1B TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to XXp1()
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
XXp1(): executing fork of first child
Phase 1B TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to the first XXp2()
XXp2(): started
XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
XXp2(): This XXp2() process will now quit().
