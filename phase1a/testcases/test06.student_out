testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: Create XXp1 (moderate priority); that creates 2 XXp2 children (low priority).  XXp1 will block on join(), which will cause main() to wake up and report the fork() results - after which the XXp2 processes will run.
Phase 1B TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to XXp1()
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
XXp1(): executing fork of first child
XXp1(): fork1 of first child returned pid = 5
XXp1(): executing fork of second child
XXp1(): fork1 of second child returned pid = 6
XXp1(): performing first join
Phase 1B TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to testcase_main(), since XXp1 has created its two children, which are lower priority than
