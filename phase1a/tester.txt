Phase 1B TEMPORARY HACK: init() manually switching to testcase_main() after using fork1() to create it.
testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: Simple fork()/join() should complete.
Phase 1B TEMPORARY HACK: Manually switching to the recently created XXp1()
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
testcase_main(): after fork of child 4
testcase_main(): performing join
testcase_main(): exit status for child 4 is 3
Phase 1B TEMPORARY HACK: testcase_main() returned, simulation will now halt.
TESTCASE ENDED: Call counts:   check_io() 0   clockHandler() 0
